6. WHEN a user searches for connections THEN the system SHALL provide graph-based visualization of document relationships

### Requirement 5: Real-time Collaborative Editing

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate on documents with others in real-time, so that we can work together efficiently with proper conflict resolution and change tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users edit the same document THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes in real-time without conflicts
2. WHEN users make simultaneous edits THEN the system SHALL use operational transformation to merge changes intelligently
3. WHEN a user joins a collaborative session THEN the system SHALL show active collaborators with cursor positions and selections
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed change history with author attribution
