In a recent talk David Brooks says: '''David Brooks on Elite Rigging and Societal Breakdown

Source: Excerpts from "How the Elite rigged Society (and why itâ€™s falling apart) | David Brooks"

Main Themes:

The Educated Elite and Inequality: Brooks, identifying himself as a member of the educated elite, argues that this group has unintentionally (or intentionally) created a system that advantages themselves and disadvantages others, leading to significant inequality in material outcomes, health, and social connection.
The Privatization of Morality: Brooks contends that the elite have eroded the shared moral order, leading to a decline in trust, meaning, and overall societal well-being, and that America has become a "sadder society."
The Rise of Disruption Conservatives (Trump): Brooks posits that figures like Donald Trump, while appearing populist, are actually members of the elite who are anti-left rather than genuinely conservative. They seek to dismantle existing institutions without offering a positive vision.
The Potential for Renewal through Suffering: Brooks expresses optimism that moments of suffering and national crisis can lead to societal transformation and a renewed sense of community and shared values.
Culture Change, Not Political Change: Culture changes when a creative minority finds a beautiful way to live and others copy them. "Attention is the purest form of generosity."
Key Ideas and Facts:

Elite Rigging of the System: Brooks argues that the elite have designed a meritocracy that favors their own skills and backgrounds, leading to a caste system where success is largely determined by background.
"We designed a meritocracy designed around the skills we ourselves possess and rigged the game so we succeeded and everybody else failed."
"54% of the people at Elite workplaces went to the same 34 Elite colleges so we ended up creating a cast system even though we pretend to be egalitarian"
Consequences of Inequality: He points to stark disparities in health, family structure, and social connection between those with and without college degrees as evidence of the damaging effects of this system.
"People with high school degrees die nine years sooner than people with college degrees people with high school degrees are five times more likely to have kids out of wedlock people with high school degrees are 2.4 times more likely to say they have no friends so we created a cast system even though we pretend to be egalitarian"
Erosion of Moral Order: Brooks argues that the emphasis on individual values and the rejection of a shared moral framework have led to a decline in societal cohesion and an increase in mental health issues.
"Without a strong moral order it's hard to have trust it's hard to find your your meaning in life and so America and I think Britain too has become a sadder Society rise in mental health rise in suicide."
Trump as an Elite Figure: Brooks challenges the notion of Trump as a populist, arguing that he and other similar figures are members of the elite who are driven by anti-left sentiment rather than a genuine conservative vision.
"Donald Trump and Elon Musk went to the University of Pennsylvania and IV League school and became billionaires JD Vance went to Yale Pete hexi went to the Princeton Yale Steven Miller went to Duke Fox News typ like Laur Ingram went to Dartmouth and they represent the educated Elite and the key factor of the educated Elite is that they're not pro-conservative they're anti-left"
The Power of Suffering: Brooks believes that moments of crisis and suffering can lead to personal and societal transformation, prompting people to re-evaluate their values and priorities.
"Those moments of suffering interrupt your life and they remind you you're not the person you thought they were...and in those moments of suffering you can either be broken or you can be broken open."
Spiritual Resources and Traditions: Brooks argues that we have many strong spiritual traditions and values which can be used to renew society. For example, the voice of Genesis is that we are all made in God's image.
Defiant Humanism: Despite the issues in society, Brooks believes in Defiant Humanism, the idea that everyone is worth understanding, respecting, and helping.
"You could be that person that person could be you and the phrase that rang in my head when I heard that was defiant humanism that even in harsh and brutal times were called upon to see each other in the fullest deepest and most respectful way that God imagined that they would be seen."
Quotes:

"If what is right and wrong depends on what each individual feels then we are outside the bounds of civilization." (Walter Litman, quoted by Brooks)
"There isn't as much Humanity as one would like but there's enough." (James Baldwin, quoted by Brooks)
Implications:

Brooks' analysis suggests a need to address the systemic inequalities created by the elite and to rebuild a shared moral framework based on empathy, community, and service to others. It also challenges conventional political labels and calls for a deeper understanding of the motivations driving figures like Donald Trump. Finally, Brooks believes the future of society lies in cultural change rather than political change and that society is in a moment of rupture and repair.'''

## Response

Okay, let's break down the connection between the pursuit of higher profit margins by American businesses, outsourcing, and the "narcissistic elitism" that David Brooks describes.

**The Pursuit of Higher Profit Margins and Outsourcing**

The drive for higher profit margins is a fundamental characteristic of capitalist economies, particularly in the United States. Here's why:

*   **Shareholder Value:** Publicly traded companies are primarily accountable to their shareholders. Shareholders expect returns on their investments, and higher profits translate to higher stock prices and dividends. This creates immense pressure on management to maximize profitability.
*   **Competition:**  The competitive landscape in many industries is fierce. Companies are constantly trying to gain an edge over their rivals, and increasing profit margins is a key way to achieve this.
*   **Executive Compensation:** Executive compensation packages are often tied to company performance, particularly profitability. This incentivizes executives to prioritize strategies that boost the bottom line.
*   **Capital Investment:** Higher profits allow companies to reinvest in research and development, new technologies, and expansion, further solidifying their competitive position.

Outsourcing, especially to countries with lower labor costs, is a direct consequence of this profit-driven imperative. It allows companies to:

*   **Reduce Labor Costs:** Labor is often a significant expense. Outsourcing to countries with lower wages can dramatically reduce these costs, boosting profit margins.
*   **Focus on Core Competencies:** By outsourcing non-core activities (e.g., manufacturing, customer service, data entry), companies can focus their resources and expertise on activities that generate higher value and strategic advantage.
*   **Increase Efficiency:** In some cases, outsourcing can lead to greater efficiency and productivity, as specialized outsourcing providers may have expertise and technology that the company lacks.

**Connecting to Brooks' "Narcissistic Elitism"**

Here's where the connection to Brooks' concept of "narcissistic elitism" comes into play:

1.  **Elite-Driven System:** Brooks argues that the educated elite have created a system that advantages themselves and disadvantages others. The pursuit of higher profit margins, while seemingly a neutral economic activity, can be seen as a manifestation of this system. The elite, often educated at top universities and holding positions of power in corporations, design and implement strategies like outsourcing that disproportionately benefit themselves (through increased shareholder value, executive compensation, and career advancement) while negatively impacting others (through job losses, wage stagnation, and community decline).
2.  **Moral Blindness:** Brooks contends that the elite have eroded the shared moral order. The relentless pursuit of profit, even at the expense of workers and communities, can be seen as a consequence of this moral erosion. The elite may be so focused on maximizing shareholder value that they fail to consider the broader social and ethical implications of their decisions. They may rationalize outsourcing by arguing that it's necessary for competitiveness or that it creates jobs in other countries, while ignoring the negative consequences for American workers.
3.  **Meritocratic Justification:** Brooks criticizes the elite for creating a "meritocracy" that favors their own skills and backgrounds. The corporate world often operates on a similar principle, where those with the "right" skills and education (often from elite institutions) are rewarded with high-paying jobs and opportunities for advancement. This can create a sense of entitlement and a lack of empathy for those who are less fortunate. The elite may believe that they deserve their success because they have worked hard and possess the necessary skills, failing to recognize the role that privilege and systemic advantages have played in their achievements.
4.  **Disconnection from Reality:** Brooks suggests that the elite are often disconnected from the realities faced by ordinary people. This disconnection can make it difficult for them to understand the impact of their decisions on the lives of workers and communities. They may be so insulated from the consequences of outsourcing that they don't fully appreciate the hardship it can cause.
5.  **Reinforcing Inequality:** The pursuit of higher profit margins through outsourcing exacerbates existing inequalities. It concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the elite while contributing to the decline of the middle class. This creates a vicious cycle, where the elite become increasingly wealthy and powerful, and the gap between them and the rest of society widens.
6.  **Focus on Individual Success over Collective Well-being:** Brooks emphasizes the erosion of shared values and community. The hyper-focus on maximizing profits often comes at the expense of community well-being. Companies may close factories in small towns, devastating local economies, simply because it's more profitable to move production elsewhere. This demonstrates a prioritization of individual success (the company's profit) over the collective well-being of the community.
