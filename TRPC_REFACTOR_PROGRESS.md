# tRPC Refactoring Progress

This document tracks progress on the refactoring of our application to use tRPC for type-safe API communication.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup âœ…

- [x] Create tRPC router
- [x] Set up client provider
- [x] Configure middleware for API routes

## Phase 2: Store Implementation âœ…

- [x] Document Store
- [x] LLM Store
- [x] Template Store
- [x] Configuration Store

## Phase 3: Router Implementation âœ…

- [x] Document router
- [x] LLM router
- [x] Template router
- [x] Config router
- [x] KV Cache router

## Phase 4: Type Definitions âœ…

- [x] Define shared types
- [x] Create validation schemas
- [x] Implement input/output types for procedures

## Phase 5: Component Updates âœ…

UI Components:
- [x] LLM Dialog (`src/components/trpc-llm-dialog.tsx`)
- [x] Template Tester (`src/components/trpc-template-tester.tsx`)
- [x] Document Editor (`src/components/trpc-markdown-editor.tsx`)
- [x] AI Role Switcher (`src/components/trpc-ai-role-switcher.tsx`)
- [x] Settings Panel (`src/app/trpc-settings/page.tsx`)
- [x] Folder Browser (`src/components/trpc-document-navigation.tsx`)
- [x] Admin Panel (`src/app/trpc-admin/ai-roles/page.tsx`)

## Phase 6: Migration Path âœ…

- [x] Implement parallel paths for API routes
- [x] Create dual implementations of components
- [x] Design feature flag system for switching between implementations

## Phase 7: Testing and Validation ðŸ”„

- [x] Create integration test page for tRPC components (`src/app/trpc-test-integration/page.tsx`)
- [x] Integrate test page into Settings Panel for easy access
- [ ] Test all components with real data
- [ ] Validate error handling
- [ ] Performance testing
- [x] Fix TypeScript/linter issues in Settings Panel
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript/linter issues in other components

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing and validation:
   - Finish fixing TypeScript/linter errors in remaining components
   - Verify all components handle loading states properly
   - Test error scenarios
   - Validate optimistic updates

2. Migrate API routes:
   - Remove existing API routes once tRPC functionality is confirmed
   - Update environment configuration for production

3. Documentation and cleanup:
   - Complete developer documentation
   - Remove unused code
   - Optimize bundle size

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Context Creation Challenge**
   - **Problem**: Setting up the tRPC context with access to necessary services.
   - **Solution**: Created a modular context factory that loads only the required services.

2. **Store Access Outside Components**
   - **Problem**: Accessing tRPC stores outside React components.
   - **Solution**: Implemented singleton patterns for critical stores with fallback mechanisms.

3. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - **Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across different components.
   - **Solution**: Created standardized error handling utilities with typed error responses.

4. **Type Mismatch Between API and UI**
   - **Problem**: Type discrepancies between API data and UI components.
   - **Solution**: Leveraged tRPC's type inference to automatically propagate types.

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Problem**: Some API calls were causing performance bottlenecks.
   - **Solution**: Implemented query caching, optimistic updates, and batch processing.

## Notes

- The Admin Panel component has been successfully created with tRPC integration for managing AI roles.
- A comprehensive test page has been implemented to validate tRPC functionality across all components.
- The test page has been integrated into the Settings Panel for easy access during development and testing.
- All UI components have now been refactored to use tRPC hooks for data fetching and mutations.
- Fixed linter errors in the Settings Panel component by properly using the KV Cache store for cache operations. 
- All UI components have now been refactored to use tRPC hooks for data fetching and mutations.
