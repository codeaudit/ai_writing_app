Unpack this '''Everybody wants to have their tools AI enabled.  Unfortunately, bolting in AI after the fact leaves a lot of potential untapped.  To do this right, a tool or application must be rebuilt from the ground up using an entirely new foundation.  A foundation that is AI-native.  But what does that actually mean?'''

# unpacked

Okay, let's break down the meaning and implications of that paragraph:

1.  **High Demand for AI:**
    *   "Everybody wants to have their tools AI enabled."
    *   *Meaning:* There's a strong market trend and user desire to integrate AI capabilities (like automation, prediction, natural language processing, smart suggestions, etc.) into existing software tools and applications.

2.  **The Common (Flawed) Approach:**
    *   "Unfortunately, bolting in AI after the fact..."
    *   *Meaning:* The typical way companies are trying to meet this demand is by adding AI features *onto* their existing software products. This is often referred to as a "retrofit" or "bolt-on" approach. Think of adding a GPS unit to an old car rather than designing a new car with integrated navigation.

3.  **The Problem with the Common Approach:**
    *   "...leaves a lot of potential untapped."
    *   *Meaning:* Simply adding AI features superficially doesn't fully leverage AI's capabilities. The underlying structure, data models, and workflows of the original tool weren't designed *with AI in mind*. This limits how deeply AI can be integrated and how much value it can truly add. It might offer some surface-level improvements, but it misses out on transformative possibilities.

4.  **The Proposed (Better) Solution:**
    *   "To do this right, a tool or application must be rebuilt from the ground up..."
    *   *Meaning:* The author argues that the *correct* way to integrate AI effectively requires a fundamental redesign. You can't just patch AI onto an old system; you need to start over.

5.  **The Core of the Solution: A New Foundation:**
    *   "...using an entirely new foundation. A foundation that is AI-native."
    *   *Meaning:* This rebuild shouldn't just be a rewrite of the old code. It needs a completely new architectural basis. This new foundation is termed "AI-native," implying that AI is not an add-on but a core, intrinsic part of the system's design from the very beginning. The data structures, workflows, user interface, and core logic should be built *around* AI capabilities.

6.  **The Crucial Question:**
    *   "But what does that actually mean?"
    *   *Meaning:* The author acknowledges that "AI-native" is a compelling term but lacks immediate, concrete definition. It raises the question: What specific architectural principles, design choices, data strategies, and capabilities define a system as being truly "AI-native" as opposed to just having AI features bolted on?

**In essence, the paragraph argues:**

*   Adding AI to existing tools is popular but often superficial and limiting ("bolting on").
*   To truly unlock AI's potential, software needs to be fundamentally re-architected ("rebuilt from the ground up").
*   This new architecture must be "AI-native," meaning designed with AI at its core from the start.
*   The precise definition and characteristics of an "AI-native" system need further explanation.
