The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise attributed to Sun Tzu, a high-ranking military official, strategist, and tactician. It is believed to have been written during the late Spring and Autumn period (roughly 5th century BC).

The Art of War is a philosophical work that focuses on military strategy and tactics. It emphasizes the importance of planning, deception, and discipline in warfare. The text is divided into 13 chapters, each of which addresses a different aspect of warfare, such as:

*   **Planning:** Emphasizes the importance of careful planning and preparation before engaging in battle.
