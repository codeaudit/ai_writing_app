    "name": "Art of War",
    "content": "Sun Tzu's *The Art of War* is not a manual of battlefield tactics in the modern sense, but rather a philosophical treatise on strategy and leadership applicable far beyond military conflict.  Its core principles revolve around achieving victory *before* battle even begins, emphasizing planning, deception, and understanding both oneself and the enemy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its key elements:\n\n**I.  Planning and Preparation:**\n\n* **Assessment of the Situation (Chapter 1):** This is paramount.  Sun Tzu stresses meticulous evaluation of five key factors:  the moral law (leadership and morale), heaven (weather and terrain), earth (geography and logistics), the commander (skill and experience), and method and discipline (strategy and tactics).  Understanding these elements is crucial for crafting a winning strategy.\n* **Waging War (Chapter 2):**  War should be a last resort, undertaken only when absolutely necessary and with a clear understanding of its potential costs.  Victory should be swift and decisive to minimize losses.\n* **Offensive and Defensive Strategies (Chapter 3):**  Sun Tzu advocates for attacking weaknesses and avoiding strengths, emphasizing the importance of choosing one's battles carefully and exploiting enemy vulnerabilities.  He highlights the value of both offensive and defensive maneuvers, advocating for flexibility and adaptability.\n* **Tactical Dispositions (Chapter 4):**  This chapter focuses on the deployment of troops, emphasizing the importance of maintaining order, discipline, and cohesion.  It details different formations and their strengths and weaknesses.\n* **Energy (Chapter 5):**  Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of momentum and maintaining the initiative.  He argues that a swift, decisive attack can demoralize the enemy and secure victory.\n\n**II. Deception and Maneuver:**\n\n* **Weaknesses and Strengths (Chapter 6):** Understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of the enemy, is fundamental.  Exploiting enemy weaknesses is key to victory.\n* **Maneuvering (Chapter 7):**  This chapter highlights the importance of deception and maneuvering to create advantageous positions.  The goal is to outwit the enemy and gain a decisive advantage before engaging in direct combat.\n* **Military Calculations (Chapter 8):**  Sun Tzu emphasizes the importance of careful planning and calculation before engaging in battle.  He stresses the need to anticipate the enemy's moves and prepare accordingly.\n* **Attack by Stratagem (Chapter 9):**  This chapter is dedicated to the art of deception and psychological warfare.  Sun Tzu advocates for using feints, ambushes, and other tactics to confuse and demoralize the enemy.\n\n**III. Leadership and Discipline:**\n\n* **The Army on the March (Chapter 10):**  Sun Tzu discusses the logistical aspects of warfare, including the importance of securing supply lines and maintaining discipline within the army.\n* **The Army on the Ground (Chapter 11):**  This chapter focuses on the importance of terrain and its impact on military operations.  Sun Tzu emphasizes the need to select advantageous ground and avoid unfavorable terrain.\n* **The Attack by Fire (Chapter 12):**  This chapter discusses the use of fire as a weapon, highlighting both its destructive potential and the need for careful control.\n* **The Use of Spies (Chapter 13):**  Sun Tzu emphasizes the crucial role of intelligence gathering in warfare, highlighting the importance of using spies to gather information about the enemy.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\n* **Knowing Yourself and Your Enemy:**  Understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of the enemy, is paramount to victory.\n* **Avoiding Direct Confrontation:**  When possible, outmaneuver and outwit the enemy rather than engaging in costly direct combat.\n* **The Importance of Deception:**  Use deception to confuse and disorient the enemy, creating opportunities for attack.\n* **Adaptability and Flexibility:**  Be prepared to adapt one's strategy and tactics to changing circumstances.\n* **Speed and Decisiveness:**  Swift and decisive action can often lead to victory.\n\n\n*The Art of War* is not simply a military text; its principles of strategy, leadership, and understanding human nature have found applications in business, politics, and personal life.  Its enduring relevance lies in its timeless wisdom on achieving victory through careful planning, decisive action, and a deep understanding of human psychology.\n",

This is the starting point.\n\nFrom here, you can navigate to other notes.\n\nSee my [[Daily Routine]] or learn more about [[Project Alpha]].\n\nThis is a simple example to demonstrate backlinks.\n\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Backlinks:** In Obsidian, backlinks are links *to* a note.  So, if you open `Daily Routine.md`, you'll see backlinks from `Home.md` and potentially `Project Alpha.md` (depending on how Obsidian displays them - sometimes it's only direct links, other times it's all mentions).  Similarly, `Project Alpha.md` will show backlinks from `Home.md` and `Daily Routine.md`.  `Home.md` will not show any backlinks.\n\n*   **Link Syntax:** Obsidian uses `[[ ... ]]` to create internal links.  `[[Note Name]]` creates a link to a note named \"Note Name\".  `[[Note Name|Display Text]]` creates a link to a note named \"Note Name\" but displays \"Display Text\" in the link.  This allows you to make the link more readable in context.\n\n*   **File Names:**  The file names (`Home.md`, `Daily Routine.md`, `Project Alpha.md`) are crucial. Obsidian uses the file name (without the `.md` extension) as the default \"note name\" for linking purposes.\n\n*   **Creating the Files:** To use this example:\n    1.  Open your Obsidian vault.\n    2.  Create three new files named `Home.md`, `Daily Routine.md`, and `Project Alpha.md`.\n    3.  Copy and paste the content for each file into the corresponding Obsidian file.\n    4.  Obsidian should automatically detect and display the backlinks.  Look for a \"Backlinks\" pane or section within Obsidian.  You might need to enable it in the Obsidian settings (Core Plugins -> Backlinks).\n\n*   **Purpose of the Example:** This example demonstrates how linking different notes together creates a network of information.  Obsidian's backlink feature helps you see how different ideas and concepts are connected in your vault.\n\n**How to Use This:**\n\n1.  **Copy and Paste:**  Copy the content of each file into a corresponding `.md` file in your Obsidian vault.\n2.  **Open the Backlinks Pane:** In Obsidian, make sure the \"Backlinks\" core plugin is enabled. Then, open the Backlinks pane (usually found in the right sidebar).\n3.  **Navigate:** Open each file and observe the backlinks that appear in the Backlinks pane.\n\nThis simple example should give you a good starting point for understanding and using backlinks in Obsidian. You can expand on this by creating more notes and linking them together in different ways. Remember to experiment and see how backlinks can help you organize and connect your ideas.\n",

Open your Obsidian vault.\n    2.  Create three new files named `Home.md`, `Daily Routine.md`, and `Project Alpha.md`.\n    3.  Copy and paste the content for each file into the corresponding Obsidian file.\n    4.  Obsidian should automatically detect and display the backlinks.  Look for a \"Backlinks\" pane or section within Obsidian.  You might need to enable it in the Obsidian settings (Core Plugins -> Backlinks).\n\n*   **Purpose of the Example:** This example demonstrates how linking different notes together creates a network of information.  Obsidian's backlink feature helps you see how different ideas and concepts are connected in your vault.\n\n**How to Use This:**\n\n1.  **Copy and Paste:**  Copy the content of each file into a corresponding `.md` file in your Obsidian vault.\n2.  **Open the Backlinks Pane:** In Obsidian, make sure the \"Backlinks\" core plugin is enabled. Then, open the Backlinks pane (usually found in the right sidebar).\n3.  **Navigate:** Open each file and observe the backlinks that appear in the Backlinks pane.\n\nThis simple example should give you a good starting point for understanding and using backlinks in Obsidian. You can expand on this by creating more notes and linking them together in different ways. Remember to experiment and see how backlinks can help you organize and connect your ideas.\n",

It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient updates. React is known for its flexibility and large community.\n- **Vue:** A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue is known for its ease of use, gentle learning curve, and focus on the view layer. It's often used for single-page applications and interactive components.\n- **Angular:** A comprehensive, TypeScript-based framework for building complex client-side applications. Developed and maintained by Google, Angular provides a structured environment with features like dependency injection, data binding, and routing.\n- **Next.js:** A React framework for building full-stack web applications. It offers features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, making it ideal for building performant and SEO-friendly websites.\n- **Svelte:** A JavaScript compiler that transforms your code into highly efficient, vanilla JavaScript at build time. Svelte offers a reactive programming model and eliminates the need for a virtual DOM, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance.\n\n\n## Design Resources\n\n- [Figma](https://www.figma.com)\n- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com)\n- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) (free images)\n\n## Tools\n\n- VS Code\n- GitHub\n- Vercel\n- Netlify\n\n## Related Notes\n\n- [[Project Ideas]]\n",
