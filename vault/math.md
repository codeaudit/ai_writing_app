Okay, here are Maxwell's equations in integral form:

*   **Gauss's law for electricity:**
    $$\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$

*   **Gauss's law for magnetism:**
    $$\oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0$$

*   **Faraday's law of induction:**
    $$\oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = -\frac{d}{dt} \iint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

*   **Amp√®re-Maxwell's law:**
    $$\oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \mu_0 I_{enc} + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d}{dt} \iint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$$

Would you like a breakdown of what each symbol represents? Or perhaps you'd be interested in seeing these equations in differential form as well? We could also explore the history and significance of these equations.
