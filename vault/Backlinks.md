# Backlinks

Backlinks show you which notes link to the current note. This is a powerful way to discover connections in your knowledge base.

## How Backlinks Work

When you create a link to a note using the `[[Note Name]]` syntax, that link is tracked. The target note will show that it has been linked from other notes.

For example:
- [[Internal Links]] links to this note
- [[Welcome]] links to this note

## Benefits of Backlinks

- Discover unexpected connections
- See how ideas relate to each other
- Find notes that reference the current topic
- Build a bidirectional network of knowledge

Backlinks are displayed in the right sidebar when viewing a note.
