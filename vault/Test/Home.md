Welcome to my Obsidian vault! This is the starting point.

From here, you can navigate to other notes.

See my [[Daily Routine]] or learn more about [[Project Alpha]].

This is a simple example to demonstrate backlinks.




**Explanation:**

*   **Backlinks:** In Obsidian, backlinks are links *to* a note.  So, if you open `Daily Routine.md`, you'll see backlinks from `Home.md` and potentially `Project Alpha.md` (depending on how Obsidian displays them - sometimes it's only direct links, other times it's all mentions).  Similarly, `Project Alpha.md` will show backlinks from `Home.md` and `Daily Routine.md`.  `Home.md` will not show any backlinks.

*   **Link Syntax:** Obsidian uses `[[ ... ]]` to create internal links.  `[[Note Name]]` creates a link to a note named "Note Name".  `[[Note Name|Display Text]]` creates a link to a note named "Note Name" but displays "Display Text" in the link.  This allows you to make the link more readable in context.

*   **File Names:**  The file names (`Home.md`, `Daily Routine.md`, `Project Alpha.md`) are crucial. Obsidian uses the file name (without the `.md` extension) as the default "note name" for linking purposes.

*   **Creating the Files:** To use this example:
    1.  Open your Obsidian vault.
    2.  Create three new files named `Home.md`, `Daily Routine.md`, and `Project Alpha.md`.
    3.  Copy and paste the content for each file into the corresponding Obsidian file.
    4.  Obsidian should automatically detect and display the backlinks.  Look for a "Backlinks" pane or section within Obsidian.  You might need to enable it in the Obsidian settings (Core Plugins -> Backlinks).

*   **Purpose of the Example:** This example demonstrates how linking different notes together creates a network of information.  Obsidian's backlink feature helps you see how different ideas and concepts are connected in your vault.

**How to Use This:**

1.  **Copy and Paste:**  Copy the content of each file into a corresponding `.md` file in your Obsidian vault.
2.  **Open the Backlinks Pane:** In Obsidian, make sure the "Backlinks" core plugin is enabled. Then, open the Backlinks pane (usually found in the right sidebar).
3.  **Navigate:** Open each file and observe the backlinks that appear in the Backlinks pane.

This simple example should give you a good starting point for understanding and using backlinks in Obsidian. You can expand on this by creating more notes and linking them together in different ways. Remember to experiment and see how backlinks can help you organize and connect your ideas.
