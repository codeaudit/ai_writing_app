# Interactive Components in MDX

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to include interactive components directly in your content. This example demonstrates several interactive components you can use in your documents.

## Counter Component

The Counter component allows you to maintain state directly in your document:

<Counter startValue={5} />

Try clicking the buttons above to change the counter value.

## Color Picker

The ColorPicker component provides a simple way to select and display colors:

<ColorPicker defaultColor="#3B82F6" />

## Simple Button

Buttons can be used to trigger actions:

<SimpleButton>
  Click Me!
</SimpleButton>

## Code Editor

The CodeEditor component allows you to display editable code snippets:

<CodeEditor 
  code="function greet(name) {\n  return `Hello, ${name}`;\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet('Developer'));" 
  language="javascript"
/>

## Card Component

Cards can be used to display content in an attractive format:

<Card title="Sample Card" image="https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x400/?nature">
  This is a card component with an image and some content. Cards are great for 
  displaying information in a visually appealing way.
  
  You can hover over the card to see effects.
</Card>

## Tabs Component

Tabs are useful for organizing content into discrete sections:

<Tabs>
  <TabPanel label="First Tab">
    This is the content for the first tab.
    
    * List item 1
    * List item 2
  </TabPanel>
  
  <TabPanel label="Second Tab">
    Content for the second tab goes here.
    
    ```js
    // Some code in the second tab
    const message = "Hello from tab 2!";
    console.log(message);
    ```
  </TabPanel>
  
  <TabPanel label="Third Tab">
    And here's the content for the third tab.
    
    <Alert type="warning">
      You can even include other components inside tabs!
    </Alert>
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Call to Action

Use the CallToAction component to draw attention to important actions:

<CallToAction>
  Subscribe to our newsletter!
</CallToAction>

## Bringing It All Together

These interactive components allow you to create rich, engaging content that goes beyond static text. Experiment with combining these components to create powerful documents!
