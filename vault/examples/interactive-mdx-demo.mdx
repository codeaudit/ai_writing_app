# Interactive MDX Demo

This file demonstrates the MDX capabilities of the Writing App, showing how you can combine Markdown with JSX components to create interactive documents.

## Basic Markdown Still Works

All your favorite Markdown syntax still works as expected:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists, both ordered and unordered
- [Links](https://example.com)
- > Blockquotes look like this
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('World'));
```

## JSX Components

In MDX, you can use React-style JSX components directly in your markdown:

<Alert variant="info">
  This is an info alert component that provides important information to the reader.
</Alert>

<Card title="Interactive Card Component">
  This card component can contain any content, including other markdown.
  
  - It can have lists
  - And other formatting

  ```
  Even code blocks
  ```
</Card>

## JavaScript Expressions

You can use JavaScript expressions within curly braces:

The current date is: {(new Date()).toLocaleDateString()}

2 + 2 = 4

### Dynamic Lists

You can even generate content dynamically:

<ul>
  <li><strong>React</strong> - A JavaScript framework</li>
  <li><strong>Vue</strong> - A JavaScript framework</li>
  <li><strong>Angular</strong> - A JavaScript framework</li>
  <li><strong>Svelte</strong> - A JavaScript framework</li>
</ul>

## Component Props

Components can accept properties to customize their behavior:

<Tabs>
  <TabPanel label="First Tab">
    This is the content of the first tab.
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel label="Second Tab">
    This is the content of the second tab.
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel label="Third Tab">
    This is the content of the third tab.
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Interactive Elements

MDX allows for truly interactive documents:

<Counter startValue={0} />

<ColorPicker defaultColor="#3366FF" />

## Import Statements

In MDX, you can import custom components at the top of your file:

```jsx
import { Chart } from './components/Chart'
import { DataTable } from './components/DataTable'
```

Then use them in your document:

<Chart type="bar" title="Sample Chart" />

## Internal Links

You can still use the app's internal linking syntax to reference other documents:

[[design]] - Links to the design document

## Conditional Content

You can conditionally display content based on variables:

<RestrictedContent>
  This content is only visible to logged-in users.
</RestrictedContent>

## Using MDX for Writing

MDX is perfect for:

- Technical documentation with interactive examples
- Educational content with exercises
- Scientific papers with interactive visualizations
- Creative writing with custom layouts
- Product documentation with live demos

## Custom Layouts

MDX allows for custom layouts that aren't possible with regular markdown:

<TwoColumnLayout>
  <Column width="60%">
    This column takes up 60% of the available width.
    
    It can contain regular markdown:
    
    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item
  </Column>
  <Column width="40%">
    This column takes the remaining 40%.
    
    ![An example image](https://via.placeholder.com/300x200)
    
    *Image caption goes here*
  </Column>
</TwoColumnLayout>

## Live Code Editing

With the right components, you can even create live code editors:

<CodeEditor
  language="javascript"
  code="function sayHello(name) { return 'Hello, ' + name; }"
/>

## Getting Started with MDX

To use MDX in your own documents:

1. Create a new file with the `.mdx` extension
2. Write your content using a combination of Markdown and JSX
3. Import and use any available components
4. Enjoy the power of interactive documents!

Remember, all standard Markdown syntax works alongside the JSX components, giving you the best of both worlds.

**Note**: Not all components shown in this demo may be available by default. Custom components need to be implemented and made available to the MDX renderer.
