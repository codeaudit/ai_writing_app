# Getting Started with MDX

This guide will help you understand the basics of MDX and how to use it in your documents.

## What is MDX?

MDX is simply **Markdown + JSX**. It lets you use React components right inside your Markdown documents.

Think of it this way:
- **Markdown**: Great for writing text content
- **JSX**: Great for interactive components
- **MDX**: Combines both so you can have the best of both worlds!

## Basic Examples

### Standard Markdown

MDX supports all the standard markdown syntax you're already familiar with:

#### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, or ~~strikethrough~~.

#### Lists

Unordered lists:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

#### Links and Images

[Visit the MDX website](https://mdxjs.com/)

### Simple JSX Components

Now let's add some simple JSX components:

<SimpleButton>Click Me</SimpleButton>

<Highlight color="yellow">
  This text is highlighted in yellow
</Highlight>

## How JSX Looks in MDX

JSX uses a tag-based syntax that looks similar to HTML:

```jsx
<ComponentName propName={value}>
  Content goes here
</ComponentName>
```

The key parts are:
1. Component name (always starts with a capital letter)
2. Props (attributes that customize the component)
3. Content (what goes between the opening and closing tags)

## Using JavaScript Expressions

You can use JavaScript expressions inside curly braces:

The current year is: {new Date().getFullYear()}

A simple calculation: 5 + 10 = {5 + 10}

## Mixing Markdown and JSX

You can mix markdown and JSX freely:

<Box padding={20} background="#f0f0f0">
  ## This is a markdown heading inside a Box component
  
  - You can use **bold text** and *italic text*
  - And regular markdown lists
</Box>

## Example with Props

Components can be customized with props:

<Card 
  title="My Card Title" 
  image="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200"
  bordered={true}
>
  This is the card content. You can write anything here.
</Card>

## Importing Components

At the top of your MDX file, you can import custom components:

```jsx
import { SpecialComponent } from './components/SpecialComponent'
import { MyChart } from './components/MyChart'
```

Then use them in your document.

## A Note on Component Availability

Not all components may be available by default in your MDX environment. The writing app needs to provide the components that you can use. Check the documentation for a list of available components.

## Simple Example: Tabs Component

Here's a practical example of using a tabs component:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="First Tab">
    This is the content of the first tab.
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Second Tab">
    This is the content of the second tab.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating Your First MDX Document

1. Create a new file with the `.mdx` extension
2. Start with some basic markdown content
3. Add a simple component like `<Highlight>Some text</Highlight>`
4. Save and preview your document

## When to Use MDX

MDX is great for:
- Documents that need interactive elements
- Content with custom formatting needs
- Creating reusable document patterns
- Educational content with interactive exercises

## Conclusion

That's the basics of MDX! It's a powerful way to enhance your documents with interactive components while keeping the simplicity of markdown for your content.

As you get more comfortable, you can explore more complex components and even create your own custom components for your specific needs.
