# Folder Structure

Organizing your notes in folders helps keep your knowledge base manageable as it grows.

## Creating Folders

You can create folders and subfolders to organize your notes by topic, project, or any other system that makes sense to you.

Some example folder structures:

- Projects/
  - Project A/
  - Project B/
- Areas/
  - Health/
  - Finance/
- Resources/
  - Books/
  - Articles/
- Archive/

## Moving Notes

You can move notes between folders to reorganize your vault as your needs change.

## Benefits of Good Organization

- Easier to find related notes
- Provides visual structure to your knowledge
- Helps separate different areas of your life or work
- Makes it easier to focus on specific projects or topics

Remember that you can always use search and links to find notes, regardless of where they're stored in your folder structure.
