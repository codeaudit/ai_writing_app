# Internal Links

One of the most powerful features of this app is the ability to create links between notes.

## Creating Links

To create a link to another note, use the `[[Note Name]]` syntax. For example:

- Link to [[Welcome]]
- Link to [[Markdown Support]]
- Link to [[Backlinks]]

## Following Links

You can click on any internal link to navigate to that note. If the note doesn't exist yet, you'll have the option to create it.

## Benefits of Linking

- Creates a network of connected thoughts
- Helps you discover relationships between ideas
- Makes navigation between related notes easier
- Builds a knowledge graph over time

The more you link your notes, the more valuable your knowledge base becomes.
